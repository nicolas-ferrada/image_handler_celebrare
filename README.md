## Why this project?

This project was an assignment from a selection process of a Flutter intership.

#### Image handling:

- Select images from gallery using [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_cropper).
- Image modifications (cropping, rotating, scaling, etc) using [image_cropper](https://pub.dev/packages/image_cropper).
- Custom frame images (masks) with assets using [widget_mask](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_mask).
